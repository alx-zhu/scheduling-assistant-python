# Scheduling Assistant

The scheduling assistant provides a chat interface for users to schedule events into their day; rather than doing this automatically, the user interacts with the chat directly, and can provide feedback, needs and adjustments in a conversational manner.

The assistant connects directly to Google Calendar to extract the user's events and communicates with the OpenAI API to implement chat functionality.
